Introduction
------------
The `OPNFV VES <https://wiki.opnfv.org/display/ves>`_ project aims to develop OPNFV platform
support for VNF event streams, in a common model and format intended for use by NFV Service Providers (SPs),
e.g. in managing VNF health and lifecycle. The projectâ€™s goal is to enable a significant reduction
in the effort to develop and integrate VNF telemetry-related data into automated VNF management systems,
by promoting convergence toward a common event stream format and collection system.
